# Integrate Retool into your own software

Retool CLI supports `stdout` redirects instead of writing to DAT files, meaning it can be
used as an intermediary filter tool for existing software workflows.

If you'd prefer not to integrate Retool itself but find value in its clone lists, they are
kept in a [separate repository](https://github.com/unexpectedpanda/retool-clonelists-metadata)
from the main program and are free to use.
