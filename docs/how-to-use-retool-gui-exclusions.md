# Exclusions

Retool can exclude specific types of titles from the output DAT file. These exclusions are
either based on the `<category>` tag found in DAT files, or on a string in the title's
name.

To add exclusions, in the **Global settings** or **System settings** tab, click the
**Exclusions** tab.
