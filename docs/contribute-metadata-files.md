# Edit metadata files

Metadata files contain additional language data for titles. They are periodically
generated from Redump and No-Intro databases, and should not be manually updated.

To make a change, don't submit a PR. Instead, report the issue upstream:

#### No-Intro

  1. Go to [Dat-o-matic](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/).

  1. Select the system the title is on.

  1. Do a search for the archive name of the title with the issue.

  1. Click on the title's name to open its page.

  1. Click **New ticket**, fill out the form, and then submit it.

#### Redump

Go to Redump's [**Fixes & additions** forum](http://forum.redump.org/forum/15/fixes-additions/),
and request the issue be fixed.
